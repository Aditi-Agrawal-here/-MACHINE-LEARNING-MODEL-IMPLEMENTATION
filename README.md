##Spam Message Classification

About This Project:

This project focuses on building an automated SMS spam classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The script reads a dataset containing labeled messages (spam.csv), processes the text data, extracts features, and trains a classifier to differentiate between spam and ham (non-spam) messages. The final output is a trained model that can predict whether a new message is spam or not.


Key Features:
1) Reads SMS messages from spam.csv.
2) Preprocesses text using tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
3) Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
4) Trains a spam detection model using machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.).
5) Evaluates the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6) Predicts whether a given message is spam or ham.


How It Works:
1) Read Data – The script loads SMS messages from spam.csv.
2) Preprocess Data – Cleans and transforms text using NLP techniques.
3) Feature Extraction – Converts text into numerical format using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
4) Train Model – Uses a classification algorithm (e.g., Naïve Bayes) to build the spam classifier.
5) Evaluate Model – Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6) Predict New Messages – The trained model classifies new messages as spam or ham.


Technologies Used:
1) Python
2) Pandas – Data processing and analysis
3) Scikit-learn – Machine learning model training
4) NLTK – Text preprocessing (stopword removal, stemming)
5) TF-IDF / CountVectorizer – Feature extraction from text

Installation and Usage:
1) Ensure spam.csv is present in the project folder.
2) Install required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
3) Run the script:
   python model.py


Check the Output:

Transformed Data Shape – Displays the shape of preprocessed dataset.
Model Performance Metrics – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
Prediction Results – Shows classification results (spam/ham).

Output Files:

spam.csv – Dataset containing labeled messages.
spam_classifier.pkl – Trained machine learning model.
transformed_data.pkl – Vectorized text data used for classification.

Challenges Faced and Learnings:
1) Handling text preprocessing efficiently – Removing stopwords, stemming words, and handling noisy data.
2) Choosing the best model – Experimenting with Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
3) Optimizing accuracy and performance – Tuning hyperparameters for better results.
4) Deploying a trained model – Ensuring real-time classification for incoming messages.

Conclusion:

This project provided practical experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and text classification. By utilizing Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK, we successfully built an efficient spam detection system capable of classifying SMS messages with high accuracy.
